I am an associate professor at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), and conduct my research at [Physico-Chimie Curie](https://institut-curie.org/unit/umr168).

As a physicist, I use theoretical approaches and tools from **statistical physics**, **non-equilibrium thermodynamics** and **active matter** to understand the collective behavior of cells and the dynamic properties of tissues.

My research focuses on **the development of theoretical tools** (integral geometry to capture tissue deformation, classification of microscopic interactions by the renormalization group) and **their application to specific biological problems** (interplay between mechanical, hydraulic and electric properties of tissues). My work aims at providing a better understanding of the physical processes involved during morphogenesis.

I am looking for motivated students to work on (i) the [electrohydraulics of cells and tissues](https://stages.phys.ens.psl.eu/en/offres/60) and on (ii) the[self-organization of chemotactic cell assemblies](https://stages.phys.ens.psl.eu/en/offres/59). Contact me if you are interested!
