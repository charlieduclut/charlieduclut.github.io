I am a lecturer at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), and conduct my research in the [Physico-Chimie Curie laboratory](https://institut-curie.org/unit/umr168), both in Paris, France.

As a physicist, I use theoretical approaches and tools from **statistical physics**, **non-equilibrium thermodynamics** and **soft matter** to understand the collective behavior of cells and the dynamic properties of tissues.

My research focuses on **the development of theoretical tools** (integral geometry to capture tissue deformation, classification of microscopic interactions by the renormalization group) and **their application to specific biological problems** (role of topology in the organization of cell polarity, coupling between electro-hydraulic properties and tissue growth). My work aims at providing a better understanding of the physical processes involved during morphogenesis.
