I am a postdoc in the biophysics division of the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) in Dresden, Germany.

I use theoretical approaches and tools from **statistical physics** and **soft matter physics** to understand the **collective behaviour of cells** and the **dynamic properties of tissues**.
