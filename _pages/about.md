I am a postdoc in the laboratory [Matière et Systèmes Complexes](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in Paris, France.

I use theoretical approaches and tools from **statistical physics** and **soft matter physics** to understand the **collective behaviour of cells** and the **dynamic properties of tissues**.
