    <b> Propagation of a pattern-forming front. </b>
    <br> Simulation showing the expansion of a proliferating colony. In the colony bulk, the cell density is sufficiently large to induce a local slowing down of the cells. Slow cells accumulate and form denser regions, separated by low density regions where cells move faster. The expanding front thus triggers a motility-induced pattern formation.

##  Chemotaxis and proliferation

<img src='/images/research_chemo.jpg'>

Understanding the self-organization of living systems is one of the biggest conceptual challenges of the present century. A generic mechanism that drives such organization is interaction among the individual elements — which may represent cells, bacteria, or even enzymes — via chemical signals. The ability of an individual cell to follow a gradient of chemicals is called chemotaxis.

The interplay between cellular growth and cell-cell signaling is essential for the aggregation and proliferation of bacterial colonies, as well as for the self-organization of cell tissues.

> The goal is to consider microscopic and coarse-grained models for assemblies of chemotactic cells that produce their own chemical field, leading to effective long-range interactions between them. To characterize the nonlinear pattern formation stemming from the interplay between cell proliferation and cell-cell chemotactic signaling, several approaches could be considered:
> - a numerical approach, based on simulations of the microscopic equations of motions or on solving the coarse-grained partial differential equations,
> - a field-theoretical approach, that will allow characterizing the critical points and scaling properties of such colonies.
