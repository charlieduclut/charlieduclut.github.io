In addition to generating forces and reacting to mechanical cues, tissues are capable of
actively transporting fluids and of creating electric currents. Tissues hydraulic properties are crucial during morphogenesis: for instance, mammalian embryos self-organize around spherical fluid cavities (lumens). Similarly, bioelectric properties of nonexcitable cells are crucial during wound healing, and suspected to play a role in tissue patterning.

Theoretical modelling of cell tissues however often focuses on their active mechanical
properties, while their bioelectric and hydraulic abilities have remained largely undiscussed. I am therefore interested in constructing and exploring both cell-based and continuum models that bring together tissue mechanical, electrical and hydraulic properties.
