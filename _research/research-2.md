<!-- Dynamics of an isotropic cellular network under an imposed pure shear deformation. Between $t=0$ to $t=T$, a pure shear is applied to the network with a rate $\widetilde{V}_{xx}^0$, after which the box is kept fixed. The cumulative total tissue shear (blue curve) is decomposed using Eq.~\eqref{eq_shear_decomp} in contributions to the shear due to changes in cell shape (green), due to T1 transitions (red) and due to correlation effects (purple). \textbf{(a)} Example of a single simulation of the vertex model with $T=5$ and $\widetilde{V}_{xx}^0=0.15$. Snapshots show the state of the system at different times during the simulation. Cells are color-coded according to their elongation.
    \textbf{(b)} Shear decomposition averaged over 100 realizations of the vertex model for $T=6$ and $\widetilde{V}_{xx}^0=0.2$. The standard error of the mean is smaller than the thickness of the curves. -->
