excerpt: 'We introduce a technique relying on the use of auxiliary fields in order to eliminate explicit field-derivatives that plague the high orders renormalization group treatment of shift-symmetric (derivative) theories. This technique simplifies drastically the computation of fluctuations in such theories. This is illustrated by deriving the two-loop renormalization group equations—and the three-loop anomalous dimension—of the φ^4 derivative theory in D=4−ε, which is also relevant to describe the crumpled-to-flat transition of polymerized membranes. Some features of this transition are provided.'
