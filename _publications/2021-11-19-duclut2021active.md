excerpt: 'In amorphous solids as in tissues, neighbour exchanges can relax local stresses and allow the material to flow. In this paper, we use an anisotropic vertex model to study T1 rearrangements in polygonal cellular networks. We consider two different physical realization of the active anisotropic stresses: (i) anisotropic bond tension and (ii) anisotropic cell stress. Interestingly, the two types of active stress lead to patterns of oriented T1 transitions that are different. We describe and explain these observations through the lens of a continuum description of the tissue as an anisotropic active material. We furthermore discuss the energetics of the tissue and express the energy balance in terms of internal elastic energy, mechanical work, chemical work and heat. This allows us to define active T1 transitions that can perform mechanical work while consuming chemical energy.'
