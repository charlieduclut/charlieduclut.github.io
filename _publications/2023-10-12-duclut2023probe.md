excerpt: 'Odd viscoelastic materials are constrained by fewer symmetries than their even counterparts. The breaking of these symmetries allow these materials to exhibit different features, which have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Immersing a bead in such complex fluids allows for probing their physical properties, highlighting signatures of their oddity and exploring consequences of these broken symmetries. We present the conditions under which the activity of an odd viscoelastic fluid can give rise to linear instabilities in the motion of the probe particle and unveil how the features of the probe particle dynamics depend on the oddity and activity of the viscoelastic medium in which it is immersed.'
